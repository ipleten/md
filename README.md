# md - a maildir client and library

md is a foundation for handling mail directly with maildirs. It allows
you to circumvent IMAP servers and clients and deal directly with the
underlying storage.

md is designed to be a little like MH. A command line tool (which can
also be a shell) provides stateless access to your mail. 

Folders are fully supported.

md is nowhere near complete yet, and not at all usable for most people
as any kind of mail tool.

If you are interested in the approach however, here it is, ready for
you to hack on.
